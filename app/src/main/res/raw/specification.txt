Summary: Display a list of remote photos from 500px.com

Focus on the first three tasks first then, if you have time, finish the remaining tasks.

Other Requirements:
1. The project is located here: "/Users/interview/AndroidStudioProjects/interview" which is a git repo.  As you work and complete features, please check in your code.
2. After you are done with the primary features, tag the git repo with the name v1.0
3. After you are done with each secondary feature, tag the git repo with v1.1, v1.2, etc for each new feature

Primary Features:
1. Using the following API, retrieve the JSON for a set of photos
        https://api.500px.com/v1/photos?feature=fresh_today&sort=created_at&page=1&limit=10&image_size=4&include_store=store_download&include_states=voted&consumer_key=mSDECDmxoEEEw32OgaNxZxhUFuwiZetUaK9xTyTW
2. Display the list of photos in a recycler view
        Use the "image_url" key as the photo's remote location
3. Each item in the recycler view should have a parent view that is a CardView (<android.support.v7.widget.CardView>)

Secondary Features:
4. Make the photo item clickable such that it takes you to the 500px page about the photo (launch chrome or the default browser to that url).
        Each photo will have a key in the JSON called "url" with a value something like: "/photo/140866179/twin-shadows-by-bob-noble",
        if you prefix "http://500px.com" to the url value it will take you to a 500px page with more information about the photo.
5. There is a fab button in the main activity, clicking this should cause the current result to be removed and a new API call to get a fresh set of images should be initiated.
6. Make the photo item long clickable, doing so will cause the current photo to be set as the user's homescreen background image
7. Create at least one unit test

Notes:
Feel free to use google and any 3rd party libraries that you need and are familiar with.
For fetching JSON, parsing JSON, and remotely loading images, also use any library that you wish.
